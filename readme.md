#Rise - An Anchor theme

Rise is a minimal, responsive theme for the simple and lightweight CMS, [Anchor](http://anchorcms.com).

##Support
Basically, all modern browsers (Firefox, Safari, Chrome, IE9+). I'll add support for older versions of IE (at least IE8) soon.

##Demo
Check out the [demo](http://dev.stephensauceda.me/rise/) and feel free to fork the theme or let me know of [issues](https://github.com/stephensauceda/rise-anchor/issues).

Thanks!
